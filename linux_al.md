# h1 - Making first linux report

A) My first task was to download VirtualBox and linyx system to it and I did it from my home desktop Windows11 computer. 

-I started from page https://terokarvinen.com/2021/install-debian-on-virtualbox/ and went from link on that page to https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads and chose from "VirtualBox Platform Packages" Windows hosts option. 

-Then opened the VirtualBox-7.2.0-170229-Win.exe from Downloads folder and followed the installer instructions. 

-When the installation was done it opened Oracle VirtualBox Manager. I pressed from "New" -> "New Virtual Machine" window opened. 

-Followed the instructions to download debian live ISO https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/13.0.0-live/amd64/iso-hybrid/

-Kept following these instructions https://github.com/johannaheinonen/johanna-test-repo/blob/main/linux-20082025.md and got Virtual machine finally started. 

-In the start of ISO installation I was not sure what to download but after trying gnome.iso and xfce.iso I got it working. In the start I installed wrong files to wrong folder in my computer and created DVD(D) drives

-After getting the settings right and VM started all the applications worked. 


Here are some pictures:
